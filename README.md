# Deep Learning using numpy only
In this notebook we have developed a Deep Learning Model using numpy only. None of the frameworks like tensorflow, pytorch or keras are used. Problem was to predict the output of a random sequence with 1s and 0s. The output should be either 1 or 0. Output will be 1 if there are even number of 1s in the sequence otherwise it should be 0.
