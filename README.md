# Deep Learning using numpy only
This notebook demonstrates the creation of a Deep Learning Model exclusively utilizing numpy, without relying on frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. The objective was to predict the outcome of a random sequence composed of 1s and 0s. The desired output is either 1 or 0, with the rule that the output is 1 if the sequence contains an even number of 1s; otherwise, the output should be 0.
